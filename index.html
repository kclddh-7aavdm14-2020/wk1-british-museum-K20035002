It also uses some special third platforms，such as Artsandculture.google.com (virtual gallery tour)，Sketchfab.com (objects in 3D), which offers visitors much convenience.
        
        The British Empire had a significant impact on the collection of the British Museum, as officials, diplomats, missionaries and travellers acquired both large and small collections in the countries under British rule where they visited or lived. 
        
        The British museum's wide-ranging collections have grown to about eight million objects covering two million years of human history. Some of these objects were taken or purchased in regions then under British colonial rule before they were purchased, donated or bequeathed to the museum, while others were acquired through excavations, sales and other bequests by collectors. 
        
        Curators continue to acquire objects today and are actively researching the collections, including the circumstances in which objects were originally acquired, in collaboration with the museum's scientists as well as academic and community partners in the UK and across the world. 
        
        The British Museum Archive is a unique record of the Museum's activities since it was founded in 1753. It preserves the story of the Museum, the history of the collection, its collectors and the people who worked here. The Archive is a resource for researchers, academics and members of the public. It is also an essential element in supporting the ongoing research aims of the Museum and the wider research community.
